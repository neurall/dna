 I was curious how dna actually looks like as a raw data.
 
 So I thrown together simple short easily hackable DNA visualiser that downloads and shows in realtime line by line chromosome 1
 where all of 4 letters have unique 4 colors.
 
 I am mostly curious about what will I actually see.
 
 Will I see discern a patterns repetittions?
 
 Will I see color differences between different parts of DNA/chromosomes?
 
 Given how human eye and brain with it's incredible ability to spot patterns corelations repetitionshuman induction etc.
 
And Indeed ;)

So far top of chromosome 1 is reddish bottom greenish ;)
 
This is the most fascinating data I had ever chance to see.
Considering I am looking at source code of pretty much everything alive on earth.

In next step I will try to simulate drawing folded dna while still showing colors. 

Will some colors aggregate on outside ?

I.E consider painting red circle on spaghety ball and then strighten spaghety up.

You will not see a circle anymore just bunch of random red stripes. 

So lets curle dna back and then observe whether we will see patterns with naked eye ;D

O boy this is exciting ;D
